(** Test 0: introducing a variable in an exists definition *)
Goal forall n : nat, n = n.
Proof.
    assert (forall n : nat, exists m : nat, forall t : nat, (n = m)) as X.
    {
        intro n.
        pose (m := n); exists m.

        reflexivity.
    }
    intro n.
    Choose m such that exists_m_i_dunno according to (X n). 
Abort.
