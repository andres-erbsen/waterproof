(** * waterprove_with_hint
    First print an hint for reaching the target goal,
    try to prove the goal immediately afterward.

    Arguments:
        - [target_goal: constr], the goal to prove. 
        - [lemma: constr], additional lemma to pass 
            to [waterprove] for automatically
            proving the [target_goal].
*)
Ltac2 waterprove_with_hint (target_goal:constr) (lemma:constr) (shield:bool) :=
    print_goal_hint (Some target_goal);
    let lemmas := (fun () => lemma)::[] in
    waterprove target_goal lemmas shield.

(** * waterprove_without_hint
    Try to prove the goal directly using the function [waterprove].

    Arguments:
        - [target_goal: constr], the goal to prove. 
        - [lemma: constr], additional lemma to pass 
            to [waterprove] for automatically
            proving the [target_goal].
*)
Ltac2 waterprove_without_hint (target_goal:constr) (lemma:constr) (shield:bool) :=
    let lemmas := (fun () => lemma)::[] in
    waterprove target_goal lemmas shield.

Ltac2 print_failure () :=
    print (of_string "Waterproof could not find a proof. 
If you believe the statement should hold, 
try making a smaller step.").

(** * unwrap_optional_lemma
    Given an optional lemma, either returns the lemma itself,
(*     or case the argument is [None], returns a dummy lemma (I : True). *)

    Arguments:
        - [lemma: constr option], one of the following:
            - a [constr] referring to a lemma, wrapped in [Some].
            - the value [None]
    
    Returns:
        - [constr]: the provided lemma, or [dummy_lemma] in case
            the input was [None]. [dummy_lemma] simply states that [0=0].
*)
Ltac2 unwrap_optional_lemma (lemma: constr option) :=
    match lemma with
    | None => constr:(I)
    | Some y => y
    end.
